# A simple config-file for `dump1090.exe'
#
# NOTES:
#
# *) Everything after a comment `#' gets ignored.
# *) All the below keys (string before the `=') are case-insensitive.
# *) All below values (string after the `=') are the default values unless stated otherwise.
# *) A `0' for numeric values means `Infinite'.
# *) All the below key/values are parsed *before* the command-line gets parsed.
# *) A `%0' means the same as in a .BAT file; the full name of this .cfg-file.
# *) A `%~dp0' means nearly the same as in a .BAT file;
#    the directory of this .cfg-file. Except there is no `\' at the end.
#
# *) A `?' means to include this file if it exists.
#    include = ?dump1090-common.cfg
#
# *) But without the `?', include it always. If the file does not exists,
#    it's an error. Similar to how GNU-make does it: `-include foo.mak'.
#    include = dump1090-common.cfg
#
# *) A string with `%~dp0' gets expanded too:
#    message = "I am '%~dp0\dump1090.cfg'"
#
# *) Or a string with `%0':
#    message = "My full name is '%0'"
#
# *) An environment variable can be used in a value:
#      key = %ENV_VAR%
#    if `ENV_VAR' is undefined, `key' gets a default value of 0.
#
# *) Other to-do expansions:
#    %~nx0  - expand %0 to a file name and extension only
#    %~f0   - expand %0 to a fully qualified path name
